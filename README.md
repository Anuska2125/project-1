🎬 Investigating Netflix Movies

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of Netflix movies to uncover insights such as movie trends, duration distributions, and relationships between release years and genres. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

📌 Project Overview

Load and clean Netflix movie dataset

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualize patterns such as:

Movie release trends over time

Popular genres

Distribution of movie durations

Draw meaningful conclusions from visual storytelling
